# Austin's Open Data Initiative (ODI)

#### About this repo

This repo is for collaborating on work related to open data at the City of Austin. Open data is encouraged, endorsed, and funded by people and entities all across the City -- so we need a central place to collaborate and build this initiative together!

Open data projects have many flavors... they vary widely when it comes to scope and scale.
